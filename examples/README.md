# Bullet Designer examples

Example FreeCAD documents and PDF drawings for the Bullet Designer workbench.

## Example Files

### FreeCAD Documents (.FCStd)

#### 6.5mm bore riding 140 gr
**File:** `6.5mm_bore_riding_140gr.FCStd`

A 6.5 mm bore riding (land riding) bullet with 140 grains target weight. Use this as a reference or starting point for similar designs.

#### 6.5mm bore riding 150 gr
**File:** `6.5mm_bore_riding_150gr.FCStd`

A 6.5 mm bore riding (land riding) bullet with 150 grains target weight. Optimized for high ballistic coefficient.

#### 6.5mm bore riding 165 gr
**File:** `6.5mm_bore_riding_165gr.FCStd`

A 6.5 mm bore riding (land riding) bullet with 165 grains target weight. Heavy bullet design for long-range applications.

### PDF Drawings

#### 140gr bore rider 6.5mm
**File:** `140gr-bore-rider6,5mm.pdf`

Technical drawing of a 6.5 mm bore riding bullet with 140 grains target weight. Includes dimensions and specifications.

#### 150gr bore rider 6.5mm
**File:** `150gr-bore-rider6.5mm.pdf`

Technical drawing of a 6.5 mm bore riding bullet with 150 grains target weight. Includes dimensions and specifications.

## Important Note About Example Files

**Note:** Example `.FCStd` files were created with earlier versions of the Bullet Designer workbench and may use the old stability formula (threshold Sg ≥ 1.5). 

When opening these files:
- The bullet geometry will be correct
- Stability calculations may show outdated values
- **Recommendation:** Use the current Ballistic Calculator to recalculate stability with the updated Miller Stability Formula (Sg ≥ 1.8 for monolithic copper/brass bullets, Sg ≥ 1.5 for lead-core bullets)

The example files serve as good starting points for your own designs. You can modify parameters, recalculate dimensions, and update ballistic properties using the current version of the workbench.
