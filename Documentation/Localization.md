For wider usage of external workbenches, we recommend that workbench developers integrate the ability to [translate their workbench(es)](https://www.freecadweb.org/wiki/Translating_an_external_workbench). FreeCAD uses a 3rd-party crowdsource translation service called [Crowdin](https://crowdin.com/project/freecad). There are some [automated scripts](https://www.freecadweb.org/wiki/Crowdin_Scripts) that we use to push and pull translations from Crowdin via their API. Developers are invited to help improve these scripts so as to include their own workbenches in the process. Further discussion on [this forum thread](https://forum.freecadweb.org/viewtopic.php?f=10&t=36413).
