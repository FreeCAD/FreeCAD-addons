# Manual Installation

If for any reason the first option is not available, then manual installation is always possible. GitHub allows users to '[Clone or download](https://help.github.com/en/github/creating-cloning-and-archiving-repositories/cloning-a-repository)' each of the addons listed in this repository. They can be downloaded by:
* navigating to the specific addon repository 
* clicking the green 'Clone or download' â†’ Download ZIP' buttons found in the top right of each addon page  
OR
* Using `git clone <github repository URL>`  
Most of the addons must either be placed in your user's `FreeCAD/Mod` folder, or in the Macros folder. Refer to the instructions on each addon page. 

**Note**: Your user's FreeCAD folder location is obtained by typing in FreeCAD's python console: `FreeCAD.ConfigGet("UserAppData")`while the Macros folder location is indicated in the dialog opened from *Macro -> Macros...* dropdown menu.
