# Bullet Designer examples

Example FreeCAD documents for the Bullet Designer workbench.

## Important Note About Example Files

**Note:** These example bullet files (`.FCStd`) were created using an earlier version of the stability formula. The stability calculations shown in these examples use the old threshold (Sg ≥ 1.5 for all bullets). 

**Current Formula:**
- Monolithic copper/brass bullets: Sg ≥ 1.8 (stable)
- Lead-core bullets: Sg ≥ 1.5 (stable)

When you open these example files and recalculate stability using the current Ballistic Calculator, the stability values will be updated to use the correct thresholds. The example files serve as reference designs for geometry and parameters, but stability values should be recalculated with the current version.

## Example Bullets

### 6.5mm bore riding 140 gr

**File:** `6.5mm_bore_riding_140gr.FCStd`

A 6.5 mm bore riding (land riding) bullet with 140 grains target weight. Use this as a reference or starting point for similar designs.

### 6.5mm bore riding 150 gr

**File:** `6.5mm_bore_riding_150gr.FCStd`

A 6.5 mm bore riding bullet with 150 grains target weight.

### 6.5mm bore riding 165 gr

**File:** `6.5mm_bore_riding_165gr.FCStd`

A 6.5 mm bore riding bullet with 165 grains target weight.
